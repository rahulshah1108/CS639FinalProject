# CS639FinalProject

I've created this repository specifically for CS639 (Mobile Application Development) Class.

Propose Idea of Project - JustTextIt

The idea is behind this project is to just send a text when you feel shy and anxious to go and have a conversation face to face. 
Also, to share your ideas and thoughts freeky without anyone judging. The major thought behing this is that you can start a conversation with a stranger.
Even you can post your ideas and thoughts on this app and get advice from many people around the world.
This App is alo very in some gulf and Islmaic Country where people are not allowed to reveal their identity.

This app is mainly targeted for audience in the age of 16 to 40, in this app you feel nervous to talk and also meet alot of people.

For User Persona I want to share a real life experince which my friend had experienced.
On the first day of school, a guy name Parth was shy to talk with other students and ask them to be his friends. Adding to his misery, he neither had 
anyone’s contact number nor ID’s for their social media account. So, he thought of using this application, to start a conversation with other students.

The Major features of this app includes - 

Incognito texting
Making connections
Sharing your thoughts
Authenticated Data

In my opinion this app is unique becasue there are alot of texting applcations but none of those have features like texting to random people.

The technology and API's mainly used are Java, Android Studio.
API - user-update - Invoked when the user's metadata changes. 
room-enter - Invoked when the user successfully enter's a room.
room-exit Invoked when the user exixts a room. 
message-remove -invoked when a new message is received
message-remove - Invoked when a message is deleted.
room-invite - Invoked when a new room invite is received.
room-invite-response - Invoked when a response to a previous invite is received.
